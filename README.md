# Bank Management System – Java

**Exceller__Bank_management_by_JAVA** is a Java-based Bank Management System project that simulates key functionalities of a banking application.  
It is developed using object-oriented Java and showcases basic banking operations such as account creation, transaction processing, balance checks, and user interaction.

This project is suitable for beginners learning Java fundamentals, OOP concepts, and building real-world console applications.

## 🧠 About the Project

The Bank Management System allows users to:

- Create and manage bank accounts
- Perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals
- Check account balance and transaction history
- Update or delete account details (based on implementation)
- Explore core banking features using Java logic

This project demonstrates clean code structure, Java class usage, and application logic without advanced frameworks.
